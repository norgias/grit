          <h1 class="myTitle">What does having "Grit" mean?</h1>
          <p class="myPara">What does grit mean to me? To me, grit means perseverance. Grit means not giving up when faced with adversity. It means NOT being thin skinned and overly sensitive. It means having the strength to push through all of life's many challenges and still come out on top like a boss.<br><br>
  
I think that it is safe to say that during this summer's npower program everyone in both streams has demonstrated that they have grit by making it this far in the program. In talking to my peers, I know that we all have things going on in our personal lives on top of all of the stuff we have to do for npower. For me personally, I believe I’ve demonstrated grit by being faced with the daunting task of having to commute from Ajax to downtown everyday without any real source of income. Throughout the program money has always been an issue. On top of learning the course material I have been looking for a part time job to get me by. I worked a couple of odd jobs I found on kajiji and finally landed a part time position at panera bread which starts this week. It's a small victory but there's no way I am stopping there. Working and finishing the program is going to be a challenge no doubt, but i’ve still got my eye on the prize. All of this has basically taught me to never give up and to keep fighting and pushing forward no matter how tough things get. The hard work will always pay off.<br><br>

Looking at the growth mindset vs fixed mindset chart I can definitely see traits that resonate with me from both ends of the spectrum. In the past, my mindset has mainly been that of the fixed mindset. I think this is because I had a fairly easy and unchallenging childhood. However, life has definitely gotten harder as I’ve gotten older. Life first started becoming more of a challenge as I made my way into to adulthood from my late teens to early twenties. During this time my mindset was mainly fixed. I always looked for an easy way out of situations or simply gave up if something became too difficult. I didn’t understand the true value of working hard to master something. Now fast forward to my mid to late twenties and my mindset is all ‘growth’. I now know that there are no shortcuts and very little handouts in life. In a nutshell; If you want to live the ‘good life’ and have that house on the hill with the white picket fence, you’re going to have to put in the hard work. You’re going to have to have the persistence to stick with something and not give up on it when the going gets tough. It is in fighting through these challenges that we grow as individuals, and reap the benefits of that growth.<br><br>

I find the initial phase of accepting great challenges the most difficult to embrace simply because it is easier to take the easy way out and not challenge yourself. However it is important to have the foresight to see that  by pushing yourself and accepting great challenges you will only become stronger thus moving closer to your dreams. Whereas taking the easy way out will always leave you in the same place that you started at.<br> 

Overall the growth mindset is very relevant to this program and my future. The only way I am going to truly get anything out of this program is if I have the growth mindset. The only way I am going to be able to pull myself out of the mire of mediocrity and win the financial freedom that I yearn for is if I embody the growth mindset.</p>
